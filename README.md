# Ner-Israel-Web-Scrape

This is a web scraper to create a list of all the shiurim available for download from [Ner Israel Rabbinical College](https://torah.nirc.edu/speakers.html). I used the [Spacy tutorial](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/) as a base to write this (and hence the file names). The final list can be found [here](https://github.com/sethjmarcus/Ner-Israel-Web-Scrape/blob/master/tutorial/quotes-test.txt)
